How to run:

If you have located the proyect in a local server (www folder) you can already start enjoying and programming.

If you want to work frontend and backend independently you can continue. We will have our front application running locally on port 3010 that will listen to any changes we make and will refresh the browser for us.

- Run the `gulp serve` command to up start our local server. 

Finally, we can optimize many more tasks whit Gulp check the gulpfile.js and read the oficial [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) documentation.
